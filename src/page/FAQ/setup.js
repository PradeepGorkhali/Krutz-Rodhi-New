      "Nepalese students can work at the university (or one of its group companies) in their free time. International Offices at universities can sometimes help students find employment, such as contract work. In this case, you do not need to obtain a permit from the General Administration for Migration Issues of the Russian Interior Ministry. A permit is required in other cases. Tickets are only issued to full-time students at state-accredited universities. Students are only permitted to work in the profession specified in their license and in the region (city) where their university is located. However, you should not expect supplemental employment to cover your living expenses (which average $300 to $400 per month). Students in Russian universities only have a little free time due to intensive study and homework challenges. To stay focused on your studies, having your family support you or save a certain amount of money is best.",

      "This would be difficult. A Nepaleseâ€™s legal stay in Russia is guaranteed by a student visa that is valid for the duration of their studies. Foreigners who have graduated from a Russian university can only stay in Russia or find work if they have a work visa/permit. To survive and work in Russia, you must have a work visa or work permit. The documents required for legal stay in Russia after university studies are available on the General Administration for Migration Issues of the Russian Interior Ministry's website. You can also work while attending university.",

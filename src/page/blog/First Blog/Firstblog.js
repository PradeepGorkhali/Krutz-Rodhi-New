            <h3>Let’s talk about the Russian Student Visa.</h3>
            <p>
              Many people wish to pursue an education in Russia. To be able to
              do so, certain formalities must be completed, one of which is
              obtaining an education permit in Russia. The holder of this permit
              is permitted to pursue the necessary Education and tour the
              country. The Russian government issues this visa as a type of
              temporary residence permit.

              obtaining a student visa for Russia.

            <h3>What is not required for Visa for Russia?</h3>

              <li>Police Report</li>
              <li>VDC Documents</li>
              <li>Interviews</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              After submission with all the required documents, your sourced
              consultation is forwarded to the Russian embassy for verification,
              and within 45 days of the request, you get your visa. You can buy
              a ticket and fly to Russia.
              <br />
              There will be changes in the validity of an education permit in
              Russia depending on the type of course chosen by the applicant. It
              could be about three months for short-term classes, and for
              long-term studies, the validity can vary from 1 to 4 years.
              <br />
              When the documents have been submitted, there are a few things
              that you need to note -
              <br />
              If any other requirements are to be fulfilled or any mistakes in
              the application, the embassy or the agency must be informed.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If any changes are related to the application, for instance, a
                change in marital status or the birth of a child, you must
                inform the consultancy.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can even check the status of the application and the
                processing in the meantime.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                If there is a change of plans, you can withdraw the application.
                The visa fee is non-refundable.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the form is submitted along with the fees, the visa will be
                mailed to you at your registered address or can be collected by
                yourself from the consultancy office.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is also essential to note that a visa does not guarantee
                entry into the country. If the officials find an issue with your
                permit or yourself, there are chances that you will be asked to
                return to your native country.
              </li>
            </ul>
